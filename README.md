# FRIJ.js (For Real Its Just js)
This library is a "no-compile" library to help make web componets in an application. It is less than 6k right now when minified.

For now it is unadvisable to attemt to use this, but feel free to try. The store part is the crappiest but it is intregral to the system as a whole.
